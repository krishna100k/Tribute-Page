      Here's a time line of Steve Jobs's life:
    </h3>
    <ul class="list">
      <li><strong>1955</strong> - Born in San Fransisco</li>
      <li><strong>1961</strong> - The Jobs family moves to Mountain View, Calif., part of what would later become known as Silicon Valley.</li>
      <li><strong>1968</strong> - Jobs calls Bill Hewlett, the co-founder and co-namesake of Hewlett-Packard, looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter. Hewlett gives Jobs the parts, as well as an internship with the company that summer.</li>
      <li><strong>1976</strong> - Co-founds Apple Computer with Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. That same year, the company sells the Apple I in the form of a kit that sells for $666.66</li>
      <li><strong>1977</strong> - Apple incorporates.</li>
      <li><strong>1980</strong> - Apple goes public, putting Jobs' net worth north of $200 million.</li>
      <li><strong>1997</strong> - Introduces the Apple Store, which lets consumers custom-order Apple products directly from the company online.</li>
      <li><strong>2001</strong> - Introduces iTunes, then exclusively for Mac users. "iTunes is miles ahead of every other jukebox application, and we hope its dramatically simpler user interface will bring even more people into the digital music revolution."</li>
      <li><strong>2002</strong> - Apple introduces the first Windows-compatible iPods at Macworld.</li>
      <li><strong>2006</strong> - That year, Apple's market capitalization surpasses Dell's.</li>
      <li><strong>2008</strong> - Unveils MobileMe, Apple's first cloud offering: "Now users who are not part of an enterprise that runs Exchange can get the same push email, push calendars and push contacts that the big guys get."</li>
      <li><strong>2011</strong> - Resigns from Apple CEO post; becomes chairman.</li>
    </ul>
